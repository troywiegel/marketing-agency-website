Marketing Agency Website Code Refactor

I performed an audit of Horiseon's website. I changed HTML elements to follow a logical and semantic structure, 
added code to fix any broken links and made changes to ensure the webpage meets current accessibility standards.
I also consolidated code on the css style page to make it cleaner and easier to read.

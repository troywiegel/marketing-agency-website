# Marketing Agency Website Code Refactor

I audited the Marketing Agency Horiseon's website and performd a code refactor. In this refactor I:

* Changed HTML elements to follow a logical and semantic structure 
* Added code to fix any broken links and made changes to ensure the webpage meets current accessibility standards
* Consolidated code on the css style page to make it cleaner and easier to read.
